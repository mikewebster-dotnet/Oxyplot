== Annotations

// TODO //

Annotations are elements of the plot that shows information that is not part of the series collection (this also means the annotations will not show up in the series legends). Arrows, text labels, lines and areas are examples of annotations.



=== Arrows

To add an arrow to your [PlotModel]:

```cs
var arrowAnnotation = new ArrowAnnotation() { 
        StartPoint = new DataPoint(0, 0), 
        EndPoint = new DataPoint(10, 10) 
    };
myPlotModel.Annotations.Add(arrowAnnotation);
```

- The `ArrowDirection` property can be used to create an arrow that has a fixed size in screen coordinates. If this property is set, the `StartPoint` property is not used.
- `HeadLength`, `HeadWidth` and `Veeness` controls the shape of the arrow head. The values are relative to the thickness.
- The `Text` property can be used to set text that is shown at the start point of the arrow. The alignment is automatic and related to the direction of the arrow.
