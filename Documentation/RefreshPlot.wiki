== How to refresh a plot

The OxyPlot controls do not automatically refresh when you change properties of the PlotModel (e.g. changing series, axes, annotations or general plot properties).

You have the following options to update the plot:

- Change the Model property of the Plot control
- Call Invalidate/Refresh on the Plot control
- Call Invalidate/Refresh on the PlotModel
