== Contributions

Bug fixes and new features are greatly appreciated. But please read the requirements below before submitting a pull request.

Many ways to contribute, not only in code, but can also be documentation, examples, packaging etc.

New features and bugs should be added in the [https://oxyplot.codeplex.com/workitem/list/basic|issues] list. It might be a good idea to discuss in the [https://oxyplot.codeplex.com/discussions|discussion forum] first if you are not sure if it is a bug.

Then create a [https://oxyplot.codeplex.com/SourceControl/network/create/fork|new fork] and submit a [https://oxyplot.codeplex.com/SourceControl/send/contribution|pull request] when the contribution is ready.

=== Requirements for pull requests

- Include examples or unit tests for the change / new feature
- Make sure the code builds on all platforms
- Make sure all unit tests are passing
- The new code should be StyleCop compliant (see [CodingStyle|coding style])

And please:

- commit clean change lists, make it easy to review
- do not mix multiple issues in the same change list
- do not clean code in the same change list as fixing an issue, do it in a separate commit
