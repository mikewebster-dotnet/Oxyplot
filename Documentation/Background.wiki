// TODO //

- started in 2010 as a simple WPF plotting component, focusing on simplicity, performance and visual appearance.
- inspired by the books written by Edward Tufte and Stephen Few. Their principles have been imporant when designing this component.
- primarily focused on two-dimensional coordinate systems
- It is great to see that other developers find the library useful for both commercial and non-commercial use. Contributions to the source code are also greatly appreciated, look at the [https://oxyplot.codeplex.com/workitem/list/basic|issue list] and the [Contributions|contributions] pages if you would like to get involved
