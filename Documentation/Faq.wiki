== Frequently asked questions

=== Where is the source code?

You can clone the Mercurial repository from `https://hg.codeplex.com/oxyplot`, or download a zip archive from the "Source code" tab at [http://oxyplot.codeplex.com]. It is recommended to use Mercurial since the source code is frequently updated.

=== Where can I find examples?

All solutions contain an "ExampleBrowser" project that can be used to render the plots in the "ExampleLibrary" project.
The example library contains platform independent code and the source can be found in `~Source\Examples\ExampleLibrary\Examples`. There are also platform specific examples in the "Examples" solution folders.

=== The OxyPlot core library cannot be built in VS2010

You probably need to install [http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/b0e0b5e9-e138-410b-ad10-00cb3caf4981/|Portable library tools]

=== The XAML visual designer fails in VS2012

Make sure you have updated to service pack 3 or later. If it still fails you may need to repair your installation of Visual Studio.

=== Is support for 3D plots planned?

No.
